This script is designed to enhance your experience when watching video content via Android apps running through **Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA)** on Windows 10/11.

### ðŸ”§ What It Does
AutoHotkey v2 script that **automatically hides the system cursor** when a WSA window (such as youtube or any Android app) is active and the mouse remains idle for 2.5 seconds. This ensures a distraction-free, fullscreen video playback experience inside Android apps, especially where the cursor would normally remain visible and in the way.

The cursor reappears on any mouse movement or when you switch away from the Android app. You can also manually toggle the cursor at any time using **Win+C**. The script ensures the system cursor is fully restored when it exits.

### ðŸ§  What is WSA?

[**Windows Subsystem for Android**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/android/wsa/) allows you to run native Android apps on Windows, as if they were desktop applications. It is particularly useful for watching streaming content, running mobile productivity tools, or testing apps.

For example, using **YouTube** through WSA gives you access to full-screen Android video playback â€” but unlike emulators or mobile devices, **Windows doesn't automatically hide the mouse cursor** when idle inside these windows. This script fills that exact gap.
